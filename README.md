# _Turbidity Sensor_
It is the sensor to measure the turbidity of the water. The more the turbidity the less analog value is provided as output by the sensor.
It has two output: one is digital and another is analog output. Digital output pin provides a low signal when the turbidity threshold signal is reached by the sensor set by the potentiometer.
Analog output provides the analog data in raw value.
